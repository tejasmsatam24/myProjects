# BikeSharingGroupProject
#### Spring 2019
Northern Illinois University

## Collaboration

#### How do you work as a team to tackle a large problem ...

It is important to learn to work together and leverage the skills of multiple individuals to solve a problem.


### Bike Sharing
- Common service where bicycles are accessible for a temporary time period for a price or free
- Common systems either use docks (special bike racks that lock the bike) or dockless (bikes lock themselves)
- Most systems rely on smartphone applications to interface with access mechanism

### Project Timeline

- 02/20 - Introduction to *Bike Sharing* project
- 03/06 - *Bike Sharing* story
- 04/10 - *Bike Sharing* presentation

You will work as a group from a shared GitHub repository, you need to put all artifacts of the project into the repository, this includes code, feedback, reports, prototype drawings/mockups and final product.  Group repositories will be built next weekend and distributed to **team leads**.

### Bike Sharing Story (Meet in PM 251)
- On **03/06** the **Story Presenter** gives a 5 minute presentation (powerpoint)
	- 1 slide on city, bike program, anything that provides background / context [**Must include Team Lead Email Address**]
	- 1 slide on story, what do you hope to achieve with the visualization(s)
	- 1 slide of prototypes, these can be sketches or mockups
- Every other team will identify a scribe who is responsible for sending feedback to team lead on presentation, each team will get 10 emails of feedback by **03/13** from scribe

### Bike Sharing Presentation (Meet in AB 315)
- On **04/10** the **Final Presentation Presenter** gives a 5 minute presentation (powerpoint)
	- 1 *refined* slide on city, bike program, anything that provides background / context [**Must include Team Lead Email Address**]
	- 1 *refined* slide on story, what do you hope to achieve with the visualization(s)
	- A separate final image of visualization [single static image 3840 x 2160 pixels]

### Bike Sharing Presentation

- Every other team will identify a **critic** who is responsible for sending feedback to professors and team lead on presentation, each team will get 10 emails of feedback by **04/17** from critic
	- Positive critical feedback on visualization
	- Did it achieve goal?
	- Ranking 1 (best) to 11 (not as good as the other 10)

This should be roughly a paragraph to page in length and contain feedback from entire team. 

### Bike Sharing Roles
- Team Lead - responsible for communication with the professors
- Story Presenter - responsible for story presentation
- Scribe - responsible for feedback on initial story to teams
- Final Presentation Presenter - responsible for final presentation
- Critic - responsible for final feedback to teams (sent to *Team Lead*) and professors

In teams of five, everyone must have a role, in teams of four **team lead** must also do one of the other roles.

### Team Leads

- By 02/22 before 5:00PM identify **Team Lead**
- Send mail to *papka@niu.edu* and *jinsley@niu.edu*
	- Subject line `<city name> <team lead name>`
	- Identify the roles
- All correspondence from professors from that point on will be with team lead, who responsible for sharing information with team


### Rules

- Team lead will be only one sending questions/clarifications to professors
- All **email** from team lead, scribe, and critic will always start the subject line with **your team name** <city you are using>

### Final Inventory of GitHub Repository
- Prototypes
- Feedback (initial and final)
- Story presentation (powerpoint)
- Final presentation (powerpoint)
- Final visualization (3840 x 2160)
- Final report
- Code

**Do Not Put Your Data in the Repository!!!**


### Final Report
Your final report should summarize your experience (it should capture the team's view and individual experiences). What worked and didn't work.  Where did the team excel and fall short.  What would you do differently if you had more time or based on what you learned? It must include the relative contribution of each team members, we find it extremely difficult to believe that it will be 25% (20%) from all ...
