# CSCI627 Assignment07 - Scientific Visualization
In this assignment you will start with the github classroom link, create your own assignment repository, clone it to your computer, you will then install and use ParaView to create your own scientific animation.  You will save the animation and ParaView state file to your repository where you will add and commit the files, before pushing them to GitHub.

## Potential Resources:

- [Large Scale Visualization with ParaView](https://youtu.be/56NZ9eo8Kik?list=PLGj2a3KTwhRZ8o8PFh6brojw67yWT_jfd)
- Help Menu within the ParaView application
- ParaView User's Guide ([PDF](https://www.paraview.org/paraview-downloads/download.php?submit=Download&version=v5.6&type=data&os=Sources&downloadFile=ParaViewGuide-5.6.0.pdf))
- [SNL ParaView Tutorials](https://www.paraview.org/Wiki/SNL_ParaView_Tutorials)

## Learning Outcomes
- Introduction to scientific visualization and the ParaView application.
- Develop animation of scientific dataset.
- Application of different scientific visualization algorithms to scientific data.

## Directions
1. Accept github classroom assignment via link provided in email or on slack.
2. Install the appropriate [ParaView application](https://www.paraview.org/download/) on your local machine. Use release v5.5 as v5.6 has bug in the glyph component.
3. Download either the [large](http://bit.ly/largeBlood) or [small](http://bit.ly/littleBlood) bloodflow dataset, ideally use the large as it has a 100 timesteps and the small only 10.
4. Load the data into ParaView as outlined in class.
5. Create a visualization, it must include at least two representations of the data (glyphs, slices, streamlines, surfaces, etc.)
6. Once you have created a visualization that you are happy with, save the state file with filename **\<ZId>-assignment07.pvsm** to your repository.
7. Create an AVI video with the filename **\<ZId>-assignment07.avi** of your visualization for all datasets, use 10 frames per second as the framerate. Add video to your repository.
8. Commit changes to repository, remember to add a useful commit message. **DO NOT PUT DATA in your REPOSITORY**.
9. Push committed changes to github.
